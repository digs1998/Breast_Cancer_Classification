# Breast_Cancer_Classification
Using sklearn with pandas and KNN algorithm to develop a prediction model for malignant and benign tumors

In this case, we have data points of Class A and B. We want to predict what the star (test data point) is. If we consider a k value of 3 (3 nearest data points) we will obtain a prediction of Class B. Yet if we consider a k value of 6, we will obtain a prediction of Class A.
In this sense, it is important to consider the value of k. But hopefully from this diagram, you should get a sense of what the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is. It considers the 'K' Nearest Neighbors (points) when it predicts the classification of the test point.
The datasets were obtained from kaggle.com and a basic approach of KNN was applied.
